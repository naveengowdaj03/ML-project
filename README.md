The project is based on Building ML-models to predict the Heart attack risk.
Contains Data preprocessing, Data visualization, Exploratory data analysis,feature selection.
Different classifiers Random Forest Classifier,Decision Tree,Logistic Regression,Support Vector Machine,K Nearest Neighbors,BernoulliNB,GaussianNB are used and perfomance scores are calculated with confusion matrix.
